## My Notes

This project was part of the Udemy course ["React - The Complete Guide"](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/). I coded along with each lesson to create a burger builder app that allows users to customize their burger, order it, and view their past orders.

The main concepts of React were covered and libraries such as Axios and Redux were used. Firebase was used to store burger and order data. This is the class-based implementation of the project - the hooks-based implementation can be found in my other burger-builder repository.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
